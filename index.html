            <p>This is the about me section of the about me. I'm putting in some test text here until I can write something more real about myself. Mostly, I'm just trying to figure out how to structure this HTML code, which is really, really difficult. I think we should have spent longer on HTML at the beginning of the bootcamp as it is the most important building block to everything else. I really need to write some more text to see if this thing wraps. I know I should use the lorem ipsum things but its kinda nice to not be coding for a minute. I really should have stopped and got a beer on my way home.</p>
            <p>Here is some more text about me, but not about me. Maybe here I will talk about where I work currently and what I do. Here's more text. More, so much more, text. It's very fun. I am finally starting to kind of get it, but some of it is just working now and I'm not 100% sure why.</p>
            <p>Here is a final section of text in the about me. Maybe here I'll talk about my hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Or, I'll write about my dog and how much I love him despite how much he also annoys me sometimes as he is very emotional and needy.</p>
